   abstract = {The Random Forests ensemble predictor has proven to be well-suited for solving a multitudeof different prediction problems. In this thesis, we propose an extension to the Random Forestframework that allows Random Forests to be constructed for multi-output decision problemswith arbitrary combinations of classification and regression responses, with the goal ofincreasing predictive performance for such multi-output problems. We show that our methodfor combining decision tasks within the same decision tree reduces prediction error for mosttasks compared to single-output decision trees based on the same node impurity metrics, andprovide a comparison of different methods for combining such metrics. },

abstract = {By choosing different pulse sequences and their parameters, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can generate a large variety of tissue contrasts. This very flexibility, however, can yield inconsistencies with MRI acquisitions across datasets or scanning sessions that can in turn cause inconsistent automated image analysis. Although image synthesis of MR images has been shown to be helpful in addressing this problem, an inability to synthesize both T2-weighted brain images that include the skull and FLuid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) images has been reported. The method described herein, called REPLICA, addresses these limitations. REPLICA is a supervised random forest image synthesis approach that learns a nonlinear regression to predict intensities of alternate tissue contrasts given specific input tissue contrasts. Experimental results include direct image comparisons between synthetic and real images, results from image analysis tasks on both synthetic and real images, and comparison against other state-of-the-art image synthesis methods. REPLICA is computationally fast, and is shown to be comparable to other methods on tasks they are able to perform. Additionally REPLICA has the capability to synthesize both T2-weighted images of the full head and FLAIR images, and perform intensity standardization between different imaging datasets.}
